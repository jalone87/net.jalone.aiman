<h2>MASON PacMan</h2>
<p>
A two-player, two-map MASON PacMan implementation with no Console: it starts up just like a video game.  
We've set it up to be easily modifiable: 
with quick code modifications you can have as many or few Pacs as you like; 
or change the monsters; or add more maps (they're just PBM images).  Have fun!
